[![Publish and Release](https://github.com/LockTech/sequoia/actions/workflows/publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/LockTech/sequoia/actions/workflows/publish.yml)

## Abstract

Sequoia is a [`yarn create` script](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/create/) for generating NPM packages which are designed to work well with RedwoodJS applications.

It provides a dynamic, interactive prompt which configures the generated package. All prompts can be configured through command-line arguments, making re-use and quick access easy.

## Features

- Command-line argument and prompt driven configuration of generated package.
- Support for JavaScript or TypeScript source-code generation.
- Code compilation and bundling facilitated by [Microbundle](https://github.com/developit/microbundle).
- Built-in support for [linting](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/cli-commands.html#lint) and [testing](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/testing#introduction-to-testing), using the same configuration as RedwoodJS.
- Easily depend on and extend [RedwoodJS' functionality](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/tree/main/packages).
- Simple setup to support [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).
- [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to:
  - Publish your package to NPM and create a realease on GitHub.
  - Make quality assurances when PRs are opened against the `main` branch.
  - [Deploy Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/sharing/publish-storybook) to [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) whenever updates to the `main` branch occur.

## Usage

> Providing a value for an argument will skip its prompt.
